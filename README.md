# Battle School Scenario Manager
#### Author: starsnstripes

## Purpose

The purpose of the Battle School Scenario Manager is to provide a host-to-guest web interface so students running a battleSchool scenario can trigger reverts for VMs in the scenario. This application uses the Django framework to host the website and its underlying database, and is intended to be run on a battleSchool server and accessible only by its Vagrant VMs.
